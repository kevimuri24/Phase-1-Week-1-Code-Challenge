## Phase-1-Week-1-Code-Challenge
This is a repository for the week 1 code challenge that recaps on content covered between day 1 - day 9.

# I have created 6 files to hold the 6 different challnges:  

    1. Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator 
    2. Challenge 2: Speed Detector
    3. Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
    4. bonus-bubble-sort - Sort an array
    5. bonus-loop - Logs the output using "#"

# Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator 
I have developed an If function to hold the grade and iterate over the grades that the user has input and return the correct grade.
We have to create an argument that takes two arguments using the AND(&&) operator.

# Challenge 2: Speed Detector
I have created a function that measures the speed of a driver and issues the correct demerits on their license. The first part of the code will check if the speed is below 70 and return an "Ok" as the default. The challenge for this speed detector is clearly subtracting from the main speed and returning a correct figure to determine if the driver will have demerit points added to their license or not. Lastly, since the demerit points are only issued at 75 and above, I've added a short reponse to account for this.

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
In order to calculate an employees Net salary, I have taken into account their benefits, insurance, as well as all deductables before calculating taxable income and being able to console log all items. This Challenge will be built on 4 functions:

    1. payeBracket - Calculates paye after all deductions
    2. nhifBracket - Calculates NHIF based on the gross salary
    3. nssfBracket - Calculates NSSF deductible from the gross income 
    4. housingLevy - Calculate housing levy from the gross income

# Bonus challenge: sorting an array
Create a simple array and sort using the sort method.

# Bonus challenge: Looping using for
Create a base variable and pass it through a for loop as well as two other nested loops to ensure the code iterates over the users input and logs the result using a "#" sign.
